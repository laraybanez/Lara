        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a first year Graphic Design student in IADT.
            I was born in Canary Islands, Spain and I only moved to Dublin in 2018!
            I love my course and I’d say Graphic Design has become one of my passions, but other hobbies of mine include exercising, photography & online shopping hehe.
            
            This website will tell you a bit about myself, my personality and my hobbies, and it will showcase a few pieces of my work (in and out of college) + some of my photography work.</p>

        <h3>MORE ABOUT ME :)</h3>
            <p>I am 20 years old, going 21 soon, which worked out just perfect right now since I can add in pictures of a 20kg plate but not 21.

            Like I said previously, I love exercising and going to the gym. I used to play volleyball too but I had to quit many years ago.
            
            I have a younger sister, Silvia, and we are only 2 years apart, so we are super close and she takes a big part in my life! </p>

        <h3>My favourites</h3>
        <p>My favourite food in the world is sushi! For me, it is one of them foods that I could never get tired of. I deeply appreciate Japanese cuisine, I love the variety of flavours in their dishes.

            Second spot HAS to go to Spanish cuisine (I’m totally not biased). I love seafood and Mediterranean dishes, I appreciate it more after moving to Ireland as it now makes me feel nostalgic.</p>

        <h4>My favourite place is definitely Las Palmas de  Gran Canaria (again I wouldn’t be biased or anything). It is my hometown and it brings back so many memories.

            In the photo is my sister, my friend and I dressed in traditional Canarian clothes to celebrate Canary Islands day, which is May 30th, and its celebrated across all 8 islands.
